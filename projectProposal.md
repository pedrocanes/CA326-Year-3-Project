## Project Description:

A competitive turn based strategy game, based around the idea of protecting your core, and destroying your opponent’s with your army of remote-controlled high tech vehicles at your disposal. 

### Objective:

The objective of the game is to destroy your opponent’s core using an army of vehicles at your disposal, while at the same time employing strategies to defend your own core. You will have to play both offensively and defensively, to ensure that your own core is safe while also advancing on your enemy.

- To attack a core, you will need to use vehicle units created by your core. Vehicles will take a set amount of turns to be created, forcing you to choose your priorities; attack or defend. 
- To defend, you will need to strategically place your vehicles and defence units.
- You win once the enemy’s core has been destroyed, after bringing down its total health points to zero. 

### Game Environment:

You will be playing on a hexagonal board, consisting of x amount of hexagons (will be determined through playing the game, to find the perfect balance). A core for each player will be placed on opposite sides of the board. You will be able to place defences within y hexagons, relative to your core. Special ‘Trap Vehicles’ will be able to place down traps anywhere on the map, unknowingly to the enemy. Random loot would periodically drop down onto the map for you to race and collect.

Visually, it will reflect the movie, Tron, a dark environment with high contrasting neon lights giving off a future, high-tech kind of vibe.

### Player Units:

The player units will consist of two types; passive and aggressive. 

Passive units consist of defenses such as walls and traps. They will be used to set up defenses and attempt to force your enemy into re-routing their attacks, forcing them intro traps, fortifying your core and more. Some of the traps will include a sticky tile, freezing your opponents unit who triggers said trap for two turns.

Aggressive units will be used to attack other enemy units and their core. They will consist of several types, each with attribute values, allowing variation in strategy. The attributes are: Health Points, Attack, Mobility, TTB (Time To Build). Some vehicles, like the Tank, will be able to move a smaller amount of tiles per turn, but will deal higher damage and have a larger amount of health points. While others, like the Bike, will be able to travel great distances quickly, but do very little damage. How the vehicles will be used will be up to the player.
